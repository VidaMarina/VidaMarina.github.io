            The Bahía de Banderas area covers from Cabo Corrientes to Punta de Mita where multiple species of flora and fauna are maintained. In this area, fishing is one of the largest economic activities, so protection is vital to maintain the life of its organisms and ecosystems. From 2016 to 2019, more than 25 thousand tons of fish captured by boats were recorded.

        <p style="padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%;">
            In order to maintain this number of catches and not alter the order of maritime ecosystems, the government has decided to take certain actions. The government conserves the sea by regulating the amount of waste dumped into the sea, preventing oil spills, and policing maritime areas. In the country, the Permanent Program for Ecological Protection of Coastal States (PPPEEC) was implemented, whose main objective is to prevent sea pollution on coasts such as Bahía de Banderas. In more detail, this program carries out surveillance tours to detect sources of pollutants that damage the marine ecosystem, waste collection in nearby areas and conduct awareness talks for the public and some more personalized ones for fishermen and tourism service providers.

            Mexico has become one of the largest tourist countries. This aspect has become vital since it provides development for the country, environmental care and job creation. Unfortunately, apart from agriculture and industry, tourism has also increased the level of pollution in the seas. These activities create some irregularities in. Marine ecosystems that put the resources and organisms in them at risk.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%; text-align:end;">
            The sea suffers from mostly domestic pollutants. Humans are responsible for using pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, detergents, hydrocarbons, wastewater and plastics which end up washing up on the coasts. Upon entering the marine ecosystem, they spread throughout the sea, thus damaging all ecosystems and their organisms in it.

            A problem that has been created has been maintaining good water quality on beaches and seas. It has been reported that in recent years, the level of contamination has increased so that the quality of the water is in danger. Scientists have carried out experiments where by knowing the number of organisms in a bacterium, this can tell us how polluted the sea is. When doing a study of this bacterium called E. Faecalis, it was found that the beaches had reached an alarming state of water quality in past years, but in recent years these have decreased, which is a good sign.

        <font size="2" id="reference-note">

        <p style="padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%;">
            Based on domestic actions that pollute not only the sea but also the environment, this has created a big problem in the sea. The sea normally contains a degree of acidity of 8 pH. This has been altered by the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. By having a change of one unit in the pH value, the water is acidified 10 times, so the slightest alteration will have a great impact for everyone, be it humans, flora and fauna.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%;">
            This change in acidity, although it tends to be gradual, affects many marine species. Crabs, sea urchins and snails have the characteristic of having protections or shells. By increasing the pH, these animals suffer from disqualification, which is why they weaken. This event has given a lower probability of survival for the species and altered their distribution in the seas.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%;">
            Furthermore, acidification has also endangered a vital symbiosis for marine life. Coral and algae are two species that provide food and shelter for a large part of the area. By having greater acidification, the alga has had a greater difficulty in developing and reproducing, which is why the coral has died. By eliminating one of the two species in the symbiotic relationship, the other dies shortly after and in this situation it also affects most of the organisms in the marine ecosystem.
